As a part of Dr. Sork's lab, I have access to California Valley Oak growth and climate data, which I will be using for this project.

The growth data comes from trees planted in two common gardens in California. The climate data is specific to each population of Valley Oaks where seeds were taken from. There were 93 populations of Valley Oaks that have about 20 climate variables for each population.

I have access to growth data from my work in the lab last quarter (number of leaves, height if tree, and number of primary branches. I also have access to leaf morphology data that we are continuing to, and will finish analyzing, this quarter. For the project, I will have access to leaf roundness, leaf lobedness, and SLA data for each tree. 

There are many hypotheses I can test with this data, but I am currently most interested in how the leaf morphology traits differ between populations with varying climate data (mean annual percipitation, mean annual temperature, elevation, etc.). 

I plan to take averages of the leaf morphology data, which is currently seperated by individual trees, in order to get population averages of the data. I will then merge the population average morphology data with the population climate data, which are currently seperated into two files. I will then need to format the data for quantitative analysis, and visualize the results. Since we haven't done much data analysis or visualization in python or R, I'm not sure what kind of analysis I will have to do on the data to test my hypothesis.
